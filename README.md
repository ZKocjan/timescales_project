hello

the 'tools' folder contains files with functions i use

the 'test' file is just where i run them because i like to have
my stuff organized in jupyter notebook 

to run the functions you need to have a 'patches_data' folder present.
also in exactly three places in the functions i hardcoded the path to 
where i store the simulation data (sorry) - you need to change that
